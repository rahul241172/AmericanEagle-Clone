# Fashion-Mink
A clone of E-Commerce website Amercan-Eagle which has features like Search, Sort Products and Filter Products.

# Tech Stacks
For the frontend, I have used HTML and CSS JavaScript and for the backend I've  made with Node.js using Express,MongoDB Atlas Cloud and Mongoose, for User login security I've used JWT Token and Bcrypt for Password Encryption.
